This study investigates the effectiveness of Shallow and Deep neural network architectures in detecting attacks on IoT application servers. It compares four models created using a Shallow Neural Network (NN) model with a single hidden layer of 512 neurons to a Deep NN model with 7 hidden layers ranging from 256 to 4 neurons. It uses a balanced UNSW-NB15 dataset, employing 20 and 40 features. The study found that the Deep model, which utilized 40 features, consistently outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.37%. Despite slightly longer prediction times and higher resource usage, the deep models prove suitable for high-scale IoT applications, while the shallow model remains appropriate for resource-constrained IoT servers. This research contributes to enhancing IoT security by employing  NN solutions and proposes integrating the Deep model into next-generation firewall systems to protect higher-value IoT servers.  Future work involves exploring hybrid NN architectures for defending edge servers.
