The performance differences between shallow and deep models in IoT server attack detection provide crucial insights for researchers and practitioners. 



Shallow models, with simpler architectures and lower computational complexity, exhibit lower CPU and memory usage compared to deep models with multiple layers. This difference is particularly significant in resource-constrained IoT environments where scalability and efficiency are vital.

Shallow models require less RAM for storing and processing model parameters and intermediate computations, contributes to their lower memory consumption. This memory efficiency is essential in IoT settings where resources are limited, enhancing the feasibility of deployment on constrained devices.

Additionally, shallow models demonstrate faster prediction times, in contrast to deep models, which require more time for forward propagation. This difference is crucial for real-time applications like IoT server attack detection, where timely responses are necessary to mitigate security threats effectively.
In summary, understanding the trade-offs between shallow and deep models is crucial for optimizing detection system performance in IoT environments. By recognizing these differences, researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions regarding model selection and deployment strategies, ultimately enhancing security mechanisms in IoT systems.
